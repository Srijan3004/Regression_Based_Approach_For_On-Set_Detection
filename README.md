# Regression_Based_Approach_For_On-Set_Detection
The onset refers to the beginning of a musical note. So onset detection is used
to identify the time points where a new sound starts in an audio signal.
When a new musical note begins, a certain amount of increase in energy occurs.
So by keeping track of energy flow and analyzing the sound data, we can come
up with the onsets.
In modern technology, onset detection is used in several audio applications
including music information retrieval, speech recognition, and sound classification.
In this project, we develop a regression-based method of extracting onsets from
audio data
